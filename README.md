# iHeartCaller

This application is the winner of the iHeartRadio API Challenge at the 2016 AT&T Shape Hackathon. It was developed by five students in the Galvanize full stack web development program.

iHeartCaller utilizes iHeartRadio's API so listeners can browse a list of stations based on genre or city. Listeners can also submit song requests to the DJ via WebSocket-based chat.

After about 3 months of being in the Galvanize program, we wanted to see how well we would fair against other software engineers. It was definitely a rewarding experience and we learned valuable lessons on working with a team in a high-pressure, time-sensitive environment. Checkout the video below to see the app in action!
