# Shape-Hackathon

This application is the winner of the iHeartRadio Sponsor Challenge at the 2016 AT&T Shape Hackathon and was developed by five students at the Galvanize Immersive Web Development program.

HeartCaller utilizes iHeartRadio's API so users can browse a list of stations based on genre and city as well as submit song requests to the DJ via messaging and Socket.io.

After about 3 months of being in the Galvanize program, we wanted to see how well we would fair against hundreds of very talented software engineers. It was definitely a rewarding experience that really tested our knowledge and fortitude. We learned valuable lessons on working with a team in a high-pressure, time-sensitive environment and hope to participate in future hackathons. Be sure to checkout the video below to see the app in action!
